<h1> Maze-Simulation Project </h1>
<body> This project uses the implementation of data structures such as disjoint sets and algorithms such as Prim's and Kruskal's to produce a maze simulation. Currently working on adding javascript, html, and css to feature the project on a webpage and incorporate additional interactive features.
